## LSG

This folder contains resources and scripts based around the [LSG](https://cadhan.com/lsg/) (Irish Semantic Network) in order to parse the network
into a suitable format for game scripts to parse and use.

The raw LSG data is stored in `lsg-lmf.xml` which is then parsed and used to create suitable files by various Python files.
