## CartaiVsDaonnachta
Cards Against Humanity Clone, with in-game and universal chat.

Uses Node.js, Express and Socket.io

### To-Do:
- Fix bugs (currently broken)
- Add more questions (question sparsity limits the number of players who can play per game)
- Make responsive (better support for phones)
- Account for questions that require two answers
- Allow blank cards
- Make the design more modular so that it can be used as a template for more games
