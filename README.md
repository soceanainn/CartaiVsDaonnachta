# Games as Gaeilge

To start run `node app.js` and visit: `localhost:2000`

Games List:
* CartaiVsDaonnachta (Cards Against Humanity)
* [Planned] Ã‰ire Aontaithe (Risk Ireland)

## CartaiVsDaonnachta
Cards Against Humanity Clone (Irish Language Version)
Uses Node.js, Express and Socket.io

### To-Do:
- Add more questions (question sparsity limits the number of players who can play per game)
- Make responsive (support phones better)
- Account for questions that require two answers
- Allow blank cards
- Group all strings in a separate file or section (to make translation into other languages easier)
- Make the design more modular so that it can be used as a template for more games
